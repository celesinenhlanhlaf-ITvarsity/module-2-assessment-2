                            <p>When Shirley (Loretta Devine), Madea's niece, receives distressing news about her health, the only thing she wants is her family gathered around her. However, Shirley's three adult children (Shad "Bow Wow" Moss, Shannon Kane, Natalie Desselle-Reid) are too preoccupied with their own troubled lives to pay attention to their mother. It is up to Madea (Tyler Perry), with the help of rowdy Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis), to bring the clan together and help Shirley deal with her crisis.
