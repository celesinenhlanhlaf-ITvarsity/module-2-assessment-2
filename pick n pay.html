                            <p>The Pick n Pay Group is a retail business in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. The Group operates through multiple store formats under three brands â€“ Pick n Pay, Boxer and TM Supermarkets. Pick n Pay also operates one of the largest online grocery platforms in sub-Saharan Africa. Raymond Ackerman purchased the first four Pick n Pay stores in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967. Since then, the Group has grown to encompass stores across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria, eSwatini and Lesotho. Pick n Pay also owns a 49% share of Zimbabwean supermarket chain, TM Supermarkets.</p>
